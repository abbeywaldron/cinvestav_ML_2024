    "**Training [Epochs, batches and validation data]** The number of training epochs specified is denoted by `Nepochs`.  1 epoch is required to run over all of the training data.  It is possible to run batches or mini-batches of data through the training; each batch requires the optimisation to be performed, and so when specifying the `BatchSize` the training will be performed by running the optimisation $N_{epochs}\\timesN_{batches}$ times.  In general this leads to faster optimisation of the model than optimising over the full training set each time.\n",

    "**Dropout:** Coadaptation is the ability for an optimisation algorithm to allow weights to be learned where changes in one node can be compensated by changes in another node that limit the increase in performance.  This issue can be a problem for deep networks in particular where the optimisation process can involve millions of hyperparameters.  A way to combat this issue is to randomly drop-out nodes in the network each iteration of the optimisation.  That way no single paring of nodes can learn to co-adapt to the evolution of hyperparameters through the optimisation.  Thankfully all the user has to do is to set a dropout value via the variable `DropoutValue`. \n",
